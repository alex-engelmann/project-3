### Overview

At the Teal Canvas we have one primary mission: to serve artists of the creative variety, through connecting them and their artistry to various communities and outreach opportunities. We accomplish this mission by offering high caliber art exhibits/exhibitions, by supporting the development of local and regional artists and creating fun, interactive and educationally informative projects.

The Teal Canvas team emphasizes the visual medium of 2D images, digital imagery and photographic art and the opportunity for every individual to participate in the art gallery experience of displaying and selling their work in a unique way.

We accomplish this while reaching many hoops would otherwise never experience artistic originality and the joy expressive innovation can bring to a community.We reach and service communities and their talent in a way that bridges the gap and displays oneness and artistry in an exciting new way.

Join us as we spread light and creativity through the ingenuity of original ideas.
